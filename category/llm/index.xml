      <title>Navigating The Job Hunting Maze</title>
      <link>https://shaojiejiang.github.io/post/job-hunting-advice/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Embarking on a job hunt can be both exhilarating and daunting. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a fresh graduate or a seasoned professional looking for a change, the journey to land that perfect job requires more than just luck. It&amp;rsquo;s about preparation, strategy, and understanding the nuances of the job market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current climate—a mixture of hypes and depression—finding an LLM-related job has become the new favorite pursuit. However, it&amp;rsquo;s not an easy journey. To illustrate, let me share some statistics from my job-seeking experience over the past several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-experience&#34;&gt;My Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total number of jobs applied for: 200+ (I lost the exact count)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responses with interviews: 20, of which:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 were insincere ones that I could have excluded from the count&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 of the left 14 were responses to Easy Apply on LinkedIn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, despite the numerous applications, many that I prepared wholeheartedly didn&amp;rsquo;t yield more information than the word &amp;ldquo;unfortunately&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I followed the right strategy and persisted. Now, I have several attractive job offers, and I feel sorry to reject any of them. Additionally, I&amp;rsquo;ve gained many valuable things along the way, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several promising startup ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of a new programming language: Rust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significantly increased confidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Renewed good habits: reading, jogging, meditation, and attending meetups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list goes on. More importantly, here I am, sharing advice with those still deeply mired in the job hunt!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learn-the-theory----find-your-dream-job-within-100-days&#34;&gt;Learn The Theory &amp;ndash; Find Your Dream Job within 100 Days&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with the right mentality, I recommend reading &amp;ldquo;The Road to Financial Freedom II&amp;rdquo; by Bodo Schäfer. In Chapter 6, Schäfer outlines four steps to finding your dream job within 100 days. Truth be told, I set this goal and exceeded it by receiving several meaningful job offers! Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose a helpful attitude, especially if you were laid off. Being laid off can either be a catastrophe or the start of a bright future—it&amp;rsquo;s your choice!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It may be surprising, but don&amp;rsquo;t start job hunting immediately. Spend 1-3 weeks answering basic questions to understand what constitutes a meaningful job and one that gives you the &amp;ldquo;flow experience&amp;rdquo;. Don&amp;rsquo;t settle for a job that just supports your life; you deserve better! And even after finding a job, keep questioning its meaningfulness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It may surprise you again, but plan your day as if you have a proper job. Show discipline, as your biggest enemy at the moment is low spirits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a 100-day plan, including the 1-3-week thinking period mentioned above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, please read Schäfer&amp;rsquo;s book. It promises to be time well spent. Be sure to study the &amp;ldquo;success journal&amp;rdquo; section—it&amp;rsquo;s very helpful for self-affirmation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;no-pain-no-gain----embrace-rejections-as-stepping-stones&#34;&gt;No Pain No Gain &amp;ndash; Embrace Rejections as Stepping Stones&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you start seeking, you may find that the job hunt can be a rollercoaster of emotions. Adopting a &amp;ldquo;no pain, no gain&amp;rdquo; mindset is one of the first steps to success. The bitter truth is, without undergoing the painstaking procedure of hunting, finding your dream job is unlikely. Easy come, easy go. To lighten the burden, view each &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; as a step closer to that &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo;. We live in a world of continuity, not binary. Moreover, job applications and interviews are mutual selections. If they say &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; to you, they don&amp;rsquo;t deserve your &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bridging-the-gap-between-knowledge-and-action&#34;&gt;Bridging the Gap between Knowledge and Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the right mentality and making plans is one side of the coin, taking action is the other side. One does not exist without the other. This is where the ancient philosophy of &amp;lsquo;Unity of knowledge and action&amp;rsquo; (知行合一) comes into play. It&amp;rsquo;s not enough to simply know what needs to be done; action is crucial. The better you adhere to your plans, the better your achievements will be. In job seeking, this translates to a balance between learning (about the industry, job roles, and companies) and doing (tailoring your CV, networking, and applying for jobs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-prepare-your-cv-and-cover-letter&#34;&gt;How to Prepare Your CV and Cover Letter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crafting an effective CV and cover letter is an art. Your CV should not just list your experiences and skills but highlight them in a way that aligns with the job you&amp;rsquo;re applying for. Tailor your CV for each application, emphasizing the skills and experiences most relevant to the job. Your cover letter, on the other hand, is your chance to tell a story, to build a narrative&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;around your CV, explaining why you&amp;rsquo;re the perfect fit for the role. If you find this workflow burdensome, why not make use of ChatGPT, especially since you&amp;rsquo;re seeking a job in this field?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even with my best efforts (and so did ChatGPT) in the conventional application method, I received no positive responses for my dream positions. Interestingly, all the positive responses I got through &amp;ldquo;Easy Apply&amp;rdquo; on LinkedIn turned out to be enjoyable experiences for both me and the interviewers (at least they said so). Today, when discussing this with my friend Yang, he questioned whether companies hiring through &amp;lsquo;Easy Apply&amp;rsquo; are in dire need of employees. My experience suggests this might be true, but it is not what I felt in my own experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-myth-of-easy-apply-tinder-for-job-hunting&#34;&gt;The Myth of Easy Apply: Tinder for Job Hunting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern job-seeking platforms like LinkedIn have introduced the &amp;lsquo;Easy Apply&amp;rsquo; feature, akin to swiping right on Tinder. When you think of job hunting as building a romantic relationship, it might well be more akin to speed dating. Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional approach to building a &amp;ldquo;romantic relationship&amp;rdquo; with a company involves the CV tailoring and cover letter writing mentioned earlier. However, with tech companies worldwide having laid off over 400,000 employees (and more layoffs looming), recruiters might be overwhelmed by cliché-ridden application materials. Facing such a vast pool of job seekers, the likelihood of a successful application is slim. I&amp;rsquo;ve observed that most recruiters couldn&amp;rsquo;t offer insights into the rejections. Overwhelmed with formulaic applications, their responses often become equally templated. More importantly, this process also drains recruiters&amp;rsquo; energy quickly. In this scenario, &amp;ldquo;Easy Apply&amp;rdquo; emerges as a welcome relief for both job seekers and employers. This might explain its effectiveness in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;startups-vs-big-corporations&#34;&gt;Startups vs Big Corporations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing between startups and big corporations can be tough. However, if you&amp;rsquo;re considering LLM-related positions, startups often have the upper hand. Yes, most leading LLMs were developed by big companies (including OpenAI), but the open positions in these teams are scant compared to the number of job seekers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As SWYX notes:&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ~5000 LLM researchers in the world, but ~50m software engineers. Supply constraints dictate that an “in-between” class of AI Engineers will rise to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, which companies are hiring most AI Engineers? Not the big names—they&amp;rsquo;re busy competing their foundational models with each other. Startups often offer more responsibility, a chance to wear multiple hats, and a potentially dynamic work environment. In contrast, big corporations provide stability, structured growth, and often, more comprehensive benefits. Your choice should align with your career goals, personal growth plan, and work-life balance preferences. But if you&amp;rsquo;re choosing the LLMs track, startups are likely your best bet. All the large corporate positions that interviewed me were for uninteresting, old-school machine learning roles. While these positions are valuable, LLMs are where my passion currently lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job hunting is more than just a search for employment; it&amp;rsquo;s a journey of self-discovery and growth. By preparing adequately, understanding the intricacies of the application process, and aligning your job choices with your career goals, you can navigate the job market maze with confidence. Remember, each step, each rejection, and each interview is a learning experience paving the way to your ideal job.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Has the AI-Era come to video games already?</title>
      <link>https://shaojiejiang.github.io/post/ai-gaming-era/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 13 Aug 2023 17:05:13 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shaojiejiang.github.io/post/ai-gaming-era/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the big noises made by ChatGPT, many different industries have noticed the value of LLM technologies.
Unsurprisingly, the video game industry is one of them.
In this blog, I introduce several cool demos/WIPs that I&amp;rsquo;ve recently found, and share my opinions on why they might have profound influences on the future of video game industry.
I also try to explain the current difficulties, and possible directions for solving them.
In the end, I also share some dreams of future games.
I believe, the era of AI has come to video games!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-matrix-ai-powered-npcs-demo-by-the-replica-studios&#34;&gt;The Matrix AI-Powered NPCs demo by the Replica Studios&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players are used to have chats with the NPCs, but most of these conversations are scripted.
The current best conversational experience you can have with NPCs is to select from several possible responses, so you have some freedom of steering dialogues.&lt;/p&gt;


















&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-dialogue-selection-in-witcher-3&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Dialogue selection in Witcher 3&#34; srcset=&#34;

               src=&#34;https://shaojiejiang.github.io/post/ai-gaming-era/figures/dialogues-in-witcher3_hue09e192b7ac8a4706bd7f9ae742b8051_48100_527b0774b1c015883502fc1666882b7e.webp&#34;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Dialogue selection in Witcher 3
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a game lover, have you ever dreamt about talking to NPCs like they&amp;rsquo;re other human players?
Well, this is definitely possible now, and the Replica Studios already made a demo about it&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
Instead of looping over pre-scripted lines, the Replica Studios attached LMs (probably OpenAI ChatGPT) to the NPCs, allowing them to all speak characteristically.
You can even chat with NPCs using your voices directly, and they will speak back.
Take a look at this YouTube video&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many games, the plot is driven (or better put, reflected) by chatting with NPCs.
But since LLM chatbots can have randomness in their responses, maybe in the future, the game progression can be take to anywhere, so that every player can have a unique experience in the same game.
This is already partly made true in the AI Dungeon text game&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Matrix demo may look sleek in the video, but in reality it can take around 10 seconds to get a response from NPCs.
This lag is probably due to many users are calling the LLM API at the same time, and slow processing of several different modules, such as ASR and TTS.
Besides, current general-purpose LLMs like ChatGPT are very large in terms of number of parameters, and this means long processing time.
Potential solutions can be training bespoke, smaller-sized chatbot models, and maybe even audio-to-audio model so that the processing is simplified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;herika-by-dwemer-dynamics&#34;&gt;Herika by Dwemer Dynamics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience that every player being able to conduct unique conversations with each NPC can already be fascinating.
Isn&amp;rsquo;t it more interesting to have a computer-controlled companion, one that can not only chat with you, but can also follow your voice commands?
Then you definitely want to check out Herika, a mod&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&lt;/em&gt;.
Herika is a ChatGPT-powered AI companion that can understand the player&amp;rsquo;s audio and textual inputs.
She is capable of chit-chatting with the player, commenting on the game scenes and events, following the player&amp;rsquo;s various commands, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      System design of Herika. Image credit: Dwemer Dynamics
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above is an illustration of Herika&amp;rsquo;s system design.
Here is a brief overview of its main components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audio inputs and outputs are processed to and from texts by ASR and TTS modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Game objects, scenes, locations, etc., are extracted from the game as texts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The chatting and commenting are all achieved by querying the OpenAI API, in the form of role-playing chats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given player&amp;rsquo;s command in natural language, the command-following ability is achieved by asking GPT to generate formatted commands that are used by the game engine to control Herika&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out this YouTube video&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to get the feeling of how Herika works.
Although it seems to work astonishingly well in the video, currently Herika has the same problem of long response time like the Matrix demo.
Of course, another issue is that playing with such a companion can burn money quickly, and this is because most of Herika&amp;rsquo;s functionality is achieved by calling paid APIs.
Still a lot of work to do before this kind of gameplay can get popular, but this mod definitely cracks open another line of bright future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-playing-tomb-raider&#34;&gt;AI playing Tomb Raider&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, we&amp;rsquo;ve already seen AI controlling our companion in the game, then what&amp;rsquo;s next?
Controlling the player directly, of course!
Here is a video of AI playing Tomb Raider&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
In this demo, similar techniques to Herika like LLM and TTS are also used.
What&amp;rsquo;s more, it seems that the author has employed several other AI modules, too, such as object detection.
It&amp;rsquo;s not yet clear how the game character is controlled at the time of writing this blog (08/13/2023).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-work-of-ai-playing-games-in-academia&#34;&gt;More work of AI playing games, in academia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It worths noting that using modern AI&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to play games is not new.
Many previous endeavours have already been made, such as the OpenAI Five&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; playing Dota 2.
Many scientific experiments in the RL field were actually conducted on game environments like OpenAI Gym&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and Unity ML-Agents&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
However, the research characteristic of this line of work makes it far from revolutionizing the video game industry, and indeed, this was usually not the indention of researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      An example of ML-Agents.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the recent months, several other research outcomes related to video games have attracted people&amp;rsquo;s attention, e.g., Generative Agents&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; by Stanford University, and CALM&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; by Nvidia.
While Generative Agents might have put more focus on studying human behaviour instead of game playing, CALM presents an algorithms of controlling game characters using textual commands (hence easily with voice through ASR).
What&amp;rsquo;s more interesting about CALM is that the model size it uses to control the game character is as small as several hundreds of parameters, making it easily runnable locally.
Of course, attaching LMs for more flexible natural language understanding can increase the parameter size many times, but still possible to find a good middle ground between performance and latency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;outlook&#34;&gt;Outlook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the technologies for applying modern AI in games are already maturing.
Although current AI models, especially those generative ones, are often criticised for problems like hallucination, repetition, and unsafe responses etc., I would argue that such problems will be much less destructive in the game world than in real life.
It would be very interesting to see more and more games with AI companions that chat with you, and give you a hand when asked.
To make it more exciting, how about train your AI companions by yourselves, while you&amp;rsquo;re playing the game?
You already generate a lot of (labelled) data when you play games, and using it to train your AI companion is theoretically possible.
However, popular game engines like Unity and Unreal don&amp;rsquo;t directly support AI training yet, so we still need some time to make it happen.
But games with custom engines is much more flexible, and Human-Like&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is such a game that uses your data generated in the game and trains an AI opponent online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If tools aren&amp;rsquo;t a problem, what about model sizes?
In the last couple years, we saw best-performing models getting larger and larger, most of which definitely can&amp;rsquo;t run on consumer machines.
I personally believe increasing the model size isn&amp;rsquo;t the ultimate answer.
Luckily, there is another stream of research studying the grokking&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; phenomenon of models as small as an MLP, with merely several hundreds of parameters.
Probably LMs won&amp;rsquo;t have any sensible performance at this size level, but it&amp;rsquo;s possible to largely decrease the model sizes once we have enough understanding on their mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a step back, not too long ago deep learning and video games were still almost two extremes of the spectrum: the former is often associated with hard-working researchers, while the latter often reminded us of people killing time.
Gamers are usually those young and smart people, who devoted large amount of time and energy in the game they love.
Since finally the &amp;ldquo;two extremes&amp;rdquo; are coming together, maybe something more profound can happen?
Just some personal thoughts, probably unrealistic, but for instance using LLMs as portals that make the player more interested in real world, and even learn about practical skills that they can use in real life?
It might be possible, who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Omniverse™ Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) is a suite of real-time AI solutions for end-to-end development and deployment of interactive avatars and digital human applications &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, with this toolkit, you can build NPCs that can not only communicate with you in speech and synchronise lip movements, but also supplies backend LLMs.
While this was also achieved by combining several independent tools in projects like Herika, NVIDIA ACE provides a one-stop solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is its system design.&lt;/p&gt;

A main difference of AgentSims from Generative Agents is that AgentSims allows a player to join the town as the mayor and influence the agents by talking with them.
They also have an online live demo, which can be found on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.agentsims.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>One source of LLM hallucination is exposure bias</title>
      <link>https://shaojiejiang.github.io/post/llm-hallucination/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 22:16:30 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shaojiejiang.github.io/post/llm-hallucination/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the release of closed-source ChatGPT, GPT-4, and open-source LLaMa models, the LLM development has seen tremendous improvements in recent months.
While we are hyped with the fact that these LLMs are capable of many tasks, we have also noticed again and again that these LLMs hallucinate content.
Today I came accross this inspiring paper, &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14552&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sources of Hallucination by Large Language Models on Inference Tasks&lt;/a&gt; by McKenna et al., in which the authors have identified two main sources of hallucination:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge that was memorised by the model during pre-training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corpus-based heuristics such as term frequency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, I would put these two reasons into one category: the exposure bias.
This is becuase either the memorised knowledge, or frequent terms, were exposed to the LLM at pre-training state.
The observation made in this paper is very enlightning, and reminded me of an ealier paper of mine, where we also concluded that the low-diversity issue of generative chatbots are caused by frequent terms in the training corpora&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although LLMs are becoming larger, trained with more sophisticated techniques like RLHF, they have a deep root in the field of statistical models.
Losses are calculated based on terms, which are used to update the model weights, so it&amp;rsquo;s not surprising at all if the trained LLMs respond differently to terms with different frequencies.
And in fact, it would be surprising if these LLMs only learn &lt;strong&gt;perfect&lt;/strong&gt; grammar and semantics and totally shake off the frequency part.
There is nothing wrong for LLMs being statistical.
We human often make decisions based on experience, and isn&amp;rsquo;t that a kind of statistical model?
To make matters even worse, natural languages have a statistical nature too &amp;ndash; most of them, if not all, evolve over time, not neccessarily changing the meaning of words, but definitely changing the frequency speakers use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As pointed out by Konstantine Arkoudas&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, GPT-4 can&amp;rsquo;t reason.
I agree with this statement.
I think LLMs are sophisticated statistical models, and the generation process is more like information retrieval but using the neural network weights and in the granularity of tokens.
Also as mentioned by Arkoudas, the lack of reasoning in LLMs has a connection with the hallucination problem.
I agree with him and many other researchers, retrieval-augmentation could serve as the &amp;ldquo;guardrail&amp;rdquo; of LLM generations, but unlikely to be the silver bullet for eliminating the hallucination problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t be solved&amp;rdquo; is different from &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t be improved&amp;rdquo;.
Given that more and more studies have shown the vulnerability of LLMs to the statistical nature of their training data, maybe more effort is needed in thinking of a different way of training the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, it&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that the McKenna et al. work was studied under NLI.
Although the hallucination problem is more prominent in NLG, it&amp;rsquo;s not straightforwad how to do a similar analysis in the NLG scenario.
But if it can be done, it would be more attention catching.&lt;/p&gt;
